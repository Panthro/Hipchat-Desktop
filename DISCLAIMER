This project does not attempt to reverse engineer the HipChat API or
attempt to reimplement any part of the HipChat client. Any communication
between the user and HipChat servers is handled by HipChat Web itself;
this is just a native wrapper for HipChat Web, more akin to a browser
than any HipChat software.

The HipChat logo, the HipChat brand colour and the 3 images used in the
"Simple. Personal. Real Time Messaging." section of my website are owned
by HipChat and not by me.
